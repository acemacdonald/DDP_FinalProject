Using Shiny to calculate RFM

This project is a simple RFM calculator as part of the Data Science Specialization course.
It is an intro on how to use Shiny objects in R using two main components:
* server.R
* ui.R

The file 'server.R' contains the backend calculations and functionality used in the app, while the 
'ui.R' file generates the UI used to present the app. You can get a brief overview of what RFM is by 
reading the the presentation slides, or simply go ahead and start using the app yourself.

To use the app, use the following link:
